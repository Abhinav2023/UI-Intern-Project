          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
                Veggie burgers have become a popular healthy alternative to meat based burgers. These days, grocery stores and restaurants are offering many options, that try to mimic a meat texture, to custom made black bean and veggie patties and more.

          <ol>
            <li>
                Break 6 to 7 slices of bread and add in a mixer or dry grinder. You can use a few days old bread like white, brown, multi grain or whole wheat bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grind to a semi-fine consistency and do not make it floury or powdery. Place the bread crumbs in a plate or bowl. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now rinse and steam 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium to large carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ to ½ cup green peas until they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, pan or instant pot. I have listed the cooking methods below.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel and roughly chop the potatoes when warm. Also peel the cooked carrots and finely chop them and the french beans.
            </li>
          </ol>
